        <p><b>Ryo: </b>Definition and Concept of Smart Cities</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;A smart city is defined as a government and companies to develop urban services and improve the quality of life (QOL) for residents by challenging toward city issues through utilizing the latest technology such as information and communication technology (ICT). Scholars and experts have explored the definition and concept of smart city along focusing on technology, data, and urban governance.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;According to Ahvenniemi et al. (2017), a smart city is defined as cities or urban areas that have been introducing innovative technologies and data to improve the service and QOL. Furthermore, the general goal of the smart city is to support the idea of a sustainable environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the help of technology. It also emphasizes the importance of smart city development by considering a citizen-centric approach, promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The concept of a smart sustainable city has emerged as a result of three important global trends at play across the world, namely the diffusion of sustainability, the spread of urbanization, and the rise of ICT (Bibri, 2018). By operating technology and data-driven solutions wisely, smart cities can develop efficient, inclusive, and sustainable urban environments which influence QOL.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, the definition and the concept of a smart city are based on ICT and the data-driven to improve the QOL of the resident. It also contains the aspect of economic, environmental, social, and governance in various ranges. As worldwide cities have been tackling urban challenges, the notion of smart cities offers a framework for utilizing technology and innovation to generate more effective, comprehensive, and sustainable urban habitats.</p>

        <p><b>Lisa: </b>Challenges and Limitations</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;One of the biggest challenges facing smart cities is data privacy and security. As the amount of data collected by sensors and other his IoT devices grows, concerns arise about how the data is used and who has access to it. Smart cities must ensure robust data protection policies are in place to protect privacy and prevent data breaches.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another challenge facing smart cities is the digital divide. Smart city technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for citizens, but not everyone has access to it. Those who cannot afford to access or use technology may be left behind, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another drawback is cost. Smart city technologies are expensive to deploy and many cities may not have the resources to invest in these technologies. As a result, only wealthy cities can afford to deploy smart cities, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, smart city technology may not be widely accepted by the general public. Citizens may be concerned about the potential loss of privacy and the impact these technologies will have on their daily lives. This lack of acceptance can lead to resistance to smart city initiatives and limit their effectiveness.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, smart cities have the potential to improve the quality of life of their citizens, but they are not without challenges and limitations. Cities address issues such as data privacy and security, information gaps, lack of standardization, costs, and public acceptance to ensure smart city technologies are accessible and beneficial to all citizens.</p>

        <p><b>Benny: </b>Sustainable Living in Smart Cities</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Sustainable living, also called green living, refers to a lifestyle of individuals, societies or countries trying to use limited natural resources to achieve a goal of sustainability, trying to minimize pollution to a maximum extent. Sustainable living is about making lifestyle choices and decisions that are mindful of the environment, societies, and future generations. Sustainable activities include recycling rubbish, conserving energy, using public transportation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and reducing food waste. The primary goal of smart cities is to improve the quality of citizens’ life in a way that would be helpful for future generations. Sustainable living, as one key aspect of smart cities, involves applying technologies to manage existing natural resources efficiently, reduce waste, promote economic development and improve the overall well-being of citizens. One vital aspect of sustainable living in smart cities is reducing food waste, a significant issue contributing to environmental problems. According to research conducted by Conrad in 2018, over 20% of food is lost or wasted each year in the US. The authors argue that food waste is an essential indicator of sustainability because it embodies the sum of resources used to produce uneaten food, including cropland, agricultural chemicals and irrigation water and reducing food waste. Our recipe recommendation application could be crucial in promoting sustainable living by suggesting recipes based on the user’s available ingredients. The application can help our users to utilize their food resources more efficiently, thereby reducing food waste and achieving sustainability. As Conrad suggests, understanding the complex relationships between diet quality, food waste, and environmental sustainability is crucial for improving long-term food security and achieving sustainable development goals.</p>

        <p><b>Kenny: </b>Smart Cities and Health</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The concept of smart cities has been introduced to improve the quality of life and public health outcomes by integrating traditional urban infrastructures with information technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. The systematic review by Rocha et al. (2019) comprehensively analyzes the intersection of smart cities and healthcare. Their study identifies the most relevant applications of smart city infrastructure impacting healthcare provision, which include population surveillance, active aging, healthy lifestyles, support for disabled people, response to emergencies, care services organization, and socialization. The study highlights the early stage of development of most of these applications and identifies the lack of concreteness as a significant barrier to their dissemination.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another interesting perspective on this topic comes from a comparative study between Healthy Cities and Smart Cities. This study explains that initiatives for a Smart City can contribute to the construction of a Healthy City and vice versa. It discusses the differences in approaches taken by these two models, where Healthy Cities tend to use a bottom-up approach with strategies coming from the community, while Smart Cities often use a top-down approach, with technological equipment being proposed and installed by companies. The authors also note the different focuses of Healthy and Smart Cities: while Healthy Cities focus on improving the environmental, economic, and living conditions of people for the promotion of health, Smart Cities tend to focus on promoting the concentration of human capital to attract businesses and activities that transform cities into poles of global competitiveness.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;While both concepts aim to achieve quality of life, well-being, and sustainability, there are notable differences in their approaches and focuses. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these differences when planning and implementing smart city initiatives aimed at improving public health outcomes.
