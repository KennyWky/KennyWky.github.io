    <h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;One of the biggest challenges facing smart cities is data privacy and security. As the amount of data collected by sensors and other his IoT devices grows, concerns arise about how the data is used and who has access to it. Smart cities must ensure robust data protection policies are in place to protect privacy and prevent data breaches.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another challenge facing smart cities is the digital divide. Smart city technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for citizens, but not everyone has access to it. Those who cannot afford to access or use technology may be left behind, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another drawback is cost. Smart city technologies are expensive to deploy and many cities may not have the resources to invest in these technologies. As a result, only wealthy cities can afford to deploy smart cities, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, smart city technology may not be widely accepted by the general public. Citizens may be concerned about the potential loss of privacy and the impact these technologies will have on their daily lives. This lack of acceptance can lead to resistance to smart city initiatives and limit their effectiveness.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, smart cities have the potential to improve the quality of life of their citizens, but they are not without challenges and limitations. Cities address issues such as data privacy and security, information gaps, lack of standardization, costs, and public acceptance to ensure smart city technologies are accessible and beneficial to all citizens.</p>

    <h3>Sharing your recipes (upload your recipes to contribute to expanding the recipe pool)</h3>
    <p>A recipe stands for a set of instructions for preparing a particular dish, including a list of the ingredients required. Recipes were existing since humans started cooking to teach or preserve for the future to eat the same taste.[1] This literature review focuses on the positive effects of recipe sharing. 
        To begin with, sharing your recipes leads to three positive impacts. First of all, there is no other thing but the benefits of cooking at home yourself. You require effort to save cooking yourself, but after years, then you would be able to cook with your original recipes. You get several positive effects from creating the original recipe. The steps of developing original recipes are to find your inspiration, do your research, and make your own.[2] Finally, you can be motivated by sharing your recipes. Sharing recipes means other people would be assisted by your recipe, and you would be appreciated. Moreover, you would be evaluated once you share it online because some people need your recipe.[3]
