    <h3>Smart Cities and health</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The concept of smart cities has been introduced to improve the quality of life and public health outcomes by integrating traditional urban infrastructures with information technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. The systematic review by Rocha et al. (2019) comprehensively analyzes the intersection of smart cities and healthcare. Their study identifies the most relevant applications of smart city infrastructure impacting healthcare provision, which include population surveillance, active aging, healthy lifestyles, support for disabled people, response to emergencies, care services organization, and socialization. The study highlights the early stage of development of most of these applications and identifies the lack of concreteness as a significant barrier to their dissemination.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another interesting perspective on this topic comes from a comparative study between Healthy Cities and Smart Cities. This study explains that initiatives for a Smart City can contribute to the construction of a Healthy City and vice versa. It discusses the differences in approaches taken by these two models, where Healthy Cities tend to use a bottom-up approach with strategies coming from the community, while Smart Cities often use a top-down approach, with technological equipment being proposed and installed by companies. The authors also note the different focuses of Healthy and Smart Cities: while Healthy Cities focus on improving the environmental, economic, and living conditions of people for the promotion of health, Smart Cities tend to focus on promoting the concentration of human capital to attract businesses and activities that transform cities into poles of global competitiveness.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;While both concepts aim to achieve quality of life, well-being, and sustainability, there are notable differences in their approaches and focuses. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these differences when planning and implementing smart city initiatives aimed at improving public health outcomes.

    <h3>Personalized Recipes Recommendation</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Personalized recipe recommendations have a significant impact on people's lives. They help individuals discover new recipes that align with their personal preferences and dietary habits, making planning and exploring culinary possibilities easier. They also encourage healthier eating by suggesting recipes based on nutritional needs or restrictions.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;The traditional way of customizing recipes is usually that people tell Dietitians their needs, and Dietitians work out their own recipes according to their needs. But this approach often costs a lot of money and a long time. But now, with artificial intelligence, there is a new way to customize recipes. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;For instance, a system called pFoodReQ, developed by researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and IBM Research, uses a combination of machine learning and semantic understanding to provide recipe suggestions based on individual preferences and dietary needs.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Unlike traditional recipe recommendation systems, pFoodReQ uses deep learning to interpret natural language queries and considers factors such as food tags, allowed ingredients, and dietary restrictions. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Moreover, an AI-personalized recipe system like pFoodReQ is adaptive and learns from a user's past logs, enabling it to offer more personalized recommendations over time.
